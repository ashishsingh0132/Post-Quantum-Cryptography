# Post-Quantum-Cryptography
Understanding of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms and selected one for implementation based on system requirements such as security level, performance, and resource availability.

Performed high-level simulation of the selected PQC algorithm using software like MATLAB or Python to understand its workings, verify its correctness, and analyze its performance.

Designed a Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) architecture for the selected PQC algorithm, optimizing the design for system requirements such as speed, area, and power consumption.

Implemented the HDL code on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), allowing for testing and verification of the design in real hardware, as well as for rapid prototyping and iterative development.

The FPGA design for ASIC implementation, optimizing the design for area, power, and performance, and fabricating the design into custom silicon chips.
